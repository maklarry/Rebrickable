# Rebrickable
I analyzed the data model of the Rebrickable LEGO Dataset (https://lnkd.in/dhyaTd6M ) and then created a database for analytics. I went through real scenarios of answering questions about data with SQL. I explored complex problems using JOINS, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and WINDOW functions. We work on the following skills in this video: - Creating a Database in SQL Server. You can get the SQL script from my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/d6TPgm3z
I answered the following questions:
 
Q1. What is the total number of parts per theme?
Q2. What is the total number of parts per theme?
Q3. Total number of parts per year
Q4. How many sets were created in each century in the dataset?
Q5. Retrieve the set_num omitting the numbers after the hyphen(-)
Q6. What was the popular theme by year in terms of sets released in the 21st century?
Q7. What is the most produced color of Lego in terms of quantity of parts?
